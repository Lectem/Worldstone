#
# CMake module that detects if the compilers support coverage
#
# If this is the case, the build type Coverage is set up for coverage, and COVERAGE_SUPPORTED is set to true.
# By default the Coverage build type is added to CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES on multi-config generators.
# This can be controlled through the COVERAGE_IN_CONFIGURATION_TYPES option.
